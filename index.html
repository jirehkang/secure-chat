      <h2>Positioning Statement</h2>
      <p>
        For leaders at community financial institutions (CFIs) who need to offer secure,
        real-time support without straining staff or IT, Secure Chat is a compliant messaging
        platform that enables sensitive conversations anytime, across any channel. Unlike generic
        chat tools, our product is specifically built for CFIs—offering built-in compliance,
        banking-specific workflows, and always-on support powered by AI.
